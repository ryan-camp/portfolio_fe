    <p>Back-end Developer (Ruby, Rails, Python, Django) that loves to learn new things, solve problems, and make things hum.
      Whether working solo or in teams, I aim to design and write code that will make a positive impact for a business and the world.
      A life-long learner of new technologies so don't count me out on quickly picking up anything you put down.
      I have learned a bit of C language in my own time, and looking to dive into others.
      Reach out! I would be excited to speak about what I can do to help you.</p>

    <p>I also have some experience working on Vue(including Vuex and VueRouter) and React. </p>
